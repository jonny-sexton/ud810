2.d. ps0-2-b-1.png looks more like what I would expect to see in a monochrome image. Every part has some form of detail, in contrast to e.g. ps0-2-c-1.png where there is no detail in the see for example (uniform black). Therefore I expect CV algorithms to work better on ps0-2-b-1.png.
4.a.
    import numpy as np
    image_1_g_max = np.max(image_1_g)
    image_1_g_min = np.min(image_1_g)
    image_1_g_mean = np.mean(image_1_g)
    image_1_g_std = np.std(image_1_g)
    print(image_1_g_max,image_1_g_min, image_1_g_mean, image_1_g_std)

4.d. negative values indicate areas where the shifted image contained a brighter pixel than the non-shifted image.

5.c. ps0-5-b-1.png looks better, because the blue channel has a greater standard deviation?
